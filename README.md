# The-first-game-I-made-for-my-girlfriend

I made this game for my girlfriend and it's also my first game. "z" for speaking, "x" for collecting/getting, "c" for giving,

To run the game, you need to download the necessary modules via cmd, to the console respectively:

pip install python

pip install pygame

pip install pgzrun

Note: The game must be in the same directory as the images folder for it to work 
properly.
